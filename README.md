# MoleculAR
MoleculAR is the prototype of a gesture based AR desktop application.

Natural interaction technology, such as direct gesture control, is used for manipulating and constructing virtual, molecular models with bare hands. Additionally, an augmented reality workspace (using external head mounted camera) maintains and extends the natural user environment.

In general the application is based on C# - Unity (game engine V5.4.1f1).
For direct gesture interaction Leap Motion (Orion beta V3.1.3) detection utilities and hand attachments are integrated.
Virtual models are displayed via Vuforia SDK (V6.2.6) for marker based tracking.
